# Photoshop-Easing-Script
Photoshop script to let you add easings to your Photoshop animations with the timeline feature. This uses the same easings available to jQuery.

To use this script, have a file open with at least one keyframe created, the timeline set to that keyframe, and that layer selected. Then go to File > Scripts > Browse to open the script. I would recommend creating an action that you can run that will automatically load the script.

Please contact me with any questions or for help!
